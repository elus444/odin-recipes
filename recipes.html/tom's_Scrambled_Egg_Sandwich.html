    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>My dad came up with this recipe years ago. Over the years, everyone I have shared this with always reacts the same way. First, they tell me 'that sounds awful!' After they eat it their story changes to 'that was amazing!' I know the idea of mayo and mustard on a scrambled egg disk sounds odd, but trust me; you'll love it. I know the cooking method for the eggs may be sacrilege for some folks; I just ask that you try it before changing it up.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul> <li></li>2 eggs, beaten

        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        
        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
        
        <li>2 slices bread, toasted</li>
        
        <li>1 teaspoon prepared yellow mustard</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol><li>Beat eggs, milk, and salt together in a bow </li>

     <li> Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Cook eggs in hot skillet without stirring until set on the bottom, about 1 1/2 minutes. Flip eggs and cook without stirring until set on the other side, about 1 minute more. Remove from heat.</li>
        
   <li> Spread 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise on each piece of toast. Spread mustard over mayonnaise onto each piece of toast. Place eggs on one piece of toast and top with remaining toast.</li></ol>
